    "Recommender (or recommendation) systems is one of the more popular applications of Big Data and was popularized by Netflix, Amazon and Facebook. Two entities are usually handled by recommender systems: users and items. Users prefer items differently and their degree of preference is expressed by their rating also known as utility for each item. Most of the time, however, the ratings are unknown and it is up to the recommender system to predict the ratings. The data on preferences are usually displayed as a user-item matrix known as a utility matrix. To illustrate, consider the utility matrix below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| User |   HP1  |   HP2  |   HP3  |   TW   |   SW1  |   SW2  |  SW3   |\n",

    "In this example, \"HP\" refers to Harry Potter, \"TW\" to \"Twilight\" and \"SW\" to Star Wars. The ratings are integers from 1 to 5, which may correspond to the number of stars a user rated each movie. Since the ratings were explicitly assigned by the users, these are known as explicit ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may happen though that the user doesn't explicitly assign a rating and we instead rely on some proxy for concluding that a user likes an item. We call this implicit rating and examples are checking whether the user watched a movie, bought an item or clicked an ad. Converting the above utility matrix to implicit rating wherein a user \"likes\" a movie if they saw it, we may get:\n",

    "\n",
    "Utility matrices with implicit ratings have a positive value for items that were deemed liked by the user and empty values for those deemed not liked. Since the amount of user effort is less with implicit rating, we may get more nonempty values with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether implicit or explicit rating was used, notice that the utility matrices are mostly empty. The number of users and items are usually at least $10^5$ yet for every user, only a few would have seen or rated 10 or so items.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic types of recommender systems: content-based and collaborative filtering. In content-based recommender systems, items are selected based on their content (features) and the type of content the user likes. For example, if based on the user profile, the user likes round objects colored red, then the recommender system would go through all the item profiles and suggest a set of items that are closest to being round and red. On the other hand, collaborative filtering uses the ratings of items provided by users to suggest an item.\n",

However, we obviously have no choice and we have to make do with what we have. We observe that users A and C rated two movies in common but it seems that they have opposite tastes. User A have only one commonly rated movie with B but they both gave relatively high ratings on that movie. User D seems to not have any strong preference to the two movies he/she rated. A good similarity measure should be consistent with these observations.\n",

    ">The best one is Mean-centering and cosine distance simply because User A and B could be deemed as \"most similar\" because they raited HP1 highly with scores 4.0 and 5.0, respectively. Now, looking at the results from mean-centering, B has a cosine and euclidean distance of 0 with respect to A. This is consistent with my observation with A and B as most similar. The rounding method also is similar with that of mean centering, however this method is not attractive given it produces many NaNs in the data. Now, comparing to No Preprocessing, cosine distance is also 0 which is good, however the euclidean distance showed a value of 1.0 which does not align with A being similar to B. Therefore, **mean-centering** and **cosine distance** is the best combination.\n"
