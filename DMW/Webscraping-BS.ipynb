One of the key features of the program is a capstone project, taken during the fourth term, that weaves together all the knowledge the students gain in the program and bringing them all to the real-world. While working with AIM partner business, industries, and other organizations, students will go through the entire process of data-driven project implementation: from problem formulation, to design thinking, to data collection, mining and wrangling, to model building, and finally, to project deployment, while making sure that the results produce valueable insights to the business/industry. </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <br>\\n    <div class=\"course-list\">\\n      <div class=\"course-term\">First Term</div>\\n      <div class=\"course-term-color\" style=\"background-color: #67286a;\"></div>\\n      <div class=\"courses\">\\n  <div tabindex=\"1\" class=\"\">Programming for Data Science (2u)    <div tabindex=\"1\" class=\"popuptext\">\\n      <h3>Programming for Data Science</h3>\\n                <p>At the end of the course, students will:</p>\\n          <ul>\\n            <li>Understand why programming, in general, is a required skill in data science</li>\\n            <li>Be equipped with the necessary computing skills needed to perform various data science techniques and\\n              methods\\n            </li>\\n            <li>Build one of their foundational toolboxes in data science</li>\\n            <li>appreciate why Python is a useful scripting language for data scientists</li>\\n            <li>Learn how to design and program Python applications</li>\\n          </ul>\\n\\n      <p class=\"instructors\">Christian Alis, Ph.D.\\nEduardo David Jr.</p>\\n      <p class=\"units\">Units: 2</p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div tabindex=\"1\" class=\"\">Mathematics for Data Science (3u)    <div tabindex=\"1\" class=\"popuptext\">\\n      <h3>Mathematics for Data Science</h3>\\n                <p>The module introduces the mathematics, including various techniques and formulations, necessary to implement several data science models and algorithms as well as machine learning and neural network models.

As the perspective is organization-wide, the strategic management courses take a systemic, integrative and multi-functional perspective; helping the student understand the interactions of business external context, market dynamics, competitive dynamics, and internal situation and decision-making in influencing business outcomes.\\n\\n            The thinking behind the strategic management courses is that managers, especially senior executives, must contribute or add value not only by managing a function such as marketing or finance, but also by incorporating strategic frameworks to develop a strategy for his or her unit taking into consideration the enterprise strategy, and the overall objectives and needs of the entire organization.\\n            A complementary or supporting objective of the strategic management courses is to develop the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrategizing and executing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d skills of the student-managers.</p>\\n\\n      <p class=\"instructors\">Maria Elena B.

One of the key features of the program is a capstone project, taken during the fourth term, that weaves together all the knowledge the students gain in the program and bringing them all to the real-world. While working with AIM partner business, industries, and other organizations, students will go through the entire process of data-driven project implementation: from problem formulation, to design thinking, to data collection, mining and wrangling, to model building, and finally, to project deployment, while making sure that the results produce valueable insights to the business/industry. </p>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <br>\\n    <div class=\"course-list\">\\n      <div class=\"course-term\">First Term</div>\\n      <div class=\"course-term-color\" style=\"background-color: #67286a;\"></div>\\n      <div class=\"courses\">\\n  <div tabindex=\"1\" class=\"\">Programming for Data Science (2u)    <div tabindex=\"1\" class=\"popuptext\">\\n      <h3>Programming for Data Science</h3>\\n                <p>At the end of the course, students will:</p>\\n          <ul>\\n            <li>Understand why programming, in general, is a required skill in data science</li>\\n            <li>Be equipped with the necessary computing skills needed to perform various data science techniques and\\n              methods\\n            </li>\\n            <li>Build one of their foundational toolboxes in data science</li>\\n            <li>appreciate why Python is a useful scripting language for data scientists</li>\\n            <li>Learn how to design and program Python applications</li>\\n          </ul>\\n\\n      <p class=\"instructors\">Christian Alis, Ph.D.\\nEduardo David Jr.</p>\\n      <p class=\"units\">Units: 2</p>\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n  <div tabindex=\"1\" class=\"\">Mathematics for Data Science (3u)    <div tabindex=\"1\" class=\"popuptext\">\\n      <h3>Mathematics for Data Science</h3>\\n                <p>The module introduces the mathematics, including various techniques and formulations, necessary to implement several data science models and algorithms as well as machine learning and neural network models.
